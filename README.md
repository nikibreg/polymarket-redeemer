# polymarket-redeemer

This is a fully working Polymarket claim automation script built for reliability rather than optimal speed. It gets the job done end to end, but there is room for efficiency tweaks if you need higher throughput.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.4. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
